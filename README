sync_rpms.rb
------------
Synchronize RPMs from a remote yum repository to a yum repo on this machine.

Does this by:

1. Downloading .../repodata/filelists.xml.gz

2. Given the files in filelists.xml.gz, if a file matches the regex specified in
   the command line options, then:

   a. Check to see if the file already exists locally. If it does not, then
      download file and sign it using rpm --addsign




purge_rpms.rb
-------------
Purge rpm files from a yum repository.  Provides ability to specify rules so that different retention policies can
be enforced, meaning that you can specify that you want to keep the last 30 versions of lsof but only the last
3 versions of kernel.

Usage: ./purge_rpms.rb [arguments]
    -h, --help                       Show this message
    -d, --dir=DIRECTORY              DIRECTORY to purge rpm files from
    -v                               Print information about what is happening.
                                     Use multiple times for additional verbosity (e.g. -vvv)
        --rule=['FILE_REGEX,NUM_TO_KEEP']
                                     Rule pair which consists of a regular expression describing
                                     a group of rpm files and how many files of this type to keep.
                                     By default, the last 5 versions of a rpm group are kept
                                     Multiple instances of --rule may be specified for different groups of rpm files
        --dry-run                    Show what would occur, but do not actually remove any files

Examples: ./purge_rpms.rb --dir=/www/yum/5/x86_64 --rule='vmware.*,2' --rule='lsof.*,1'
          This would search in the /www/yum/5/x86_64 directory:
          -keeping 2 copies of all rpms with a %{NAME} matching the regex 'vmware.*'
          -keeping 1 copy of all rpms with a %{NAME} matching the regex 'lsof.*'
          -keeping 5 copies of all other rpms (the default rule)

          ./purge_rpms.rb --dir=/www/yum/4/i386 --rule='lsof.*,1' --rule='lsof.*,10'
          This would search in the /www/yum/4/i386 directory:
          -keeping 1 copy of all rpms with a %{NAME} matching the regex 'lsof.*'
           (this is because the first matching rule wins)
          -keeping 5 copies of all other rpms (the default rule)

          ./purge_rpms.rb --dir=/www/yum/5/x86_64 --rule='lsof.*,10' --rule='.*,3'
          This would search in the /www/yum/5/x86_64 directory:
          -keeping 10 copies of all rpms with a %{NAME} matching the regex 'lsof.*'
          -keeping 3 copies of all other rpms (overriding the default rule)
